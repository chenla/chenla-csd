* Introduction

** bootstrapping research and development

** language barriers

** cultural assumptions

** The video/lecture trap

Because English is a second language for most people in developing
countries, they are under the impression that everything can be
learned by watching videos or attending lectures.  Increasingly this
is even how a growing number of students in developing countries who
speak and read English as their primary language learn as well.  This
is a very bad habit, which must be corrected in order to do any
serious work in any field.

Books, technical & scientific papers, technical standards and
specifications should always be the primary means of learning
anything, and then use class lectures and videos to clarify, and ask
questions to help understand things that were not clear in the book or
paper.  There is no substitute for reading, taking notes and mindmaps,
working through exercises, discussing with other students, colleagues
and teachers.

This is very hard work.  Even the most brilliant scientists in the
world, including any Noble Prize winner will tell you without
hesitation that this will always be difficult no matter how long your
work in your field.  Technical and scientific papers in particular are
short, but often compress years of work by whole teams of scientists
into a few pages of very dense text.

If this is difficult for people who read English as a first language,
and attend some of the finest schools in the world, with access to
working scientists, teachers and research libraries, then it will be
far more difficult for student in a developing country who speaks and
reads english as a second language who has no direct access to any of
these things.  

This does not mean it can't be done and this is why the Centre for
STEM Development has been established.

* Career Development

The idea here is not to have only one, paper or lecture that covers
each of these topics.  We will invite STEM professionals who are
respected in their fields to contribute their own essays and lecture
videos so that each topic is covered from different points of view.
